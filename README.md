# mixed-virtual-reality-keyboard

In past few years, Virtual Reality (VR) games and interesting scenes have developed rapidly, but there is no effective solution for text input. Existing VR input method is to use the controller ray to select letters one by one, which is unfriendly. 


In this project, we propose an intuitive text input solution in VR scenes based on traditional keyboards. Users use the keyboard in the real world, and VR scene also has a corresponding virtual keyboard. Through computer vision technology, we implement position and movement synchronization between virtual and real keyboard. We also introduce leap motion to the scene, so that users in the virtual scene can feel the movement of hands, which could increase the sense of presence in VR.
